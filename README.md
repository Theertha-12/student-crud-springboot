The Student Crud System is a CRUD application built with Java, Spring Boot, and H2 database. It enables saving, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting student records using parameters like ID, email, or index number. The system also allows filtering by date of birth range and includes custom exceptions and tests for controllers and services. Easily set up using Maven in IDEs like Eclipse, it supports testing via Postman and offers a straightforward way to manage student data efficiently.
